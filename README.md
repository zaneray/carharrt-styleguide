# carharrt-styleguide
A light css framework and digital styleguide for Carharrt

### Getting Started
Navigate to the root of this directory and run `npm install`
Run `npm run build` to initially build the CSS and JS
Open the `index.html` file in the root of this directory in a browser to view the styleguide.

This project uses SCSS to write styles, and a main.js file for simple styleguide functionality.
These are compiled with package.json scripts to prepare the final package of assets in the dist folder.

### Development
Run `npm run watch:css` to continually watch for changes in any of the scss files and compile them immediately.
Any changes in the main.js file need to be compiled with `npm run build:js`.
